## Overview

This is an app that generates random advices from an api

### The challenge

In this app, Users should be able to:

  All of this have been accomplished as seen in the app

## My process

Yeah After writing the html document, I added the css style making the body of min-height of 100vh in other to keep it static I also flexed the body and justify it content to make the main element centered then i added the animation for the dice after styling it. Then to the Javascript I called the advicetext which i had wrapped in a span element which is in a paragraph element with appostrophe thus keeping the appostrophe constant no matter the advice generated. I linked to the api, collected it slip object which returnes an id and advice afterward i just changed the span element inner content once the dice is clicked

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animation
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript api

### What I learned

I have learned more about api by building this project. Yeah I know about json and fetching data from it but this app has enabled my interact with an api and be able to build something with it
This is as seen in this part of my js code:

### Useful resources

chatgpt -- actually helped me in navigating the api initially
i thought i could get the api from the basic api url
which is https://api.adviceslip.com/advice but when i couldn't i search gpt and i realized eventually on the website that the api will only return slip object at https://api.adviceslip.com/advice
